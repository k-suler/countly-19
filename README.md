Nowadays there are a lot of security guards in front of the shops because of the corona restrictions and their job is to count how many people enter and leave the store. We found this problem very interesting and we want to find a better solution.

We decided to make an application which will track people passing in and out the store. We implement the tracker that measure the number of people traversing in and out of the store and then we send the results to the Firebase realtime database API. The results are then displayed on a web application (which is also pwa) where we show whether a certain person can enter the store or not, as well as how many people can still enter the store. In addition we also show some statistics such as when the store was least and most visited.
Web app was deployed using Netlify.
